# Key-Value Pairs

A Python dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is associated with a value.

A value in the key-value pair can be a number, a string, a list, a tuple, or even another dictionary.  
In fact, you can use a value of any valid type in Python as the value in the key-value pair.
