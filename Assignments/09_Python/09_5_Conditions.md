# Conditions

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

    Equals: a == b
    Not Equals: a != b
    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.

__Exercise 1:__

* Create a new script.
* Use the input() function to ask the user of your script for their name.  
If the name they input is your name, print a personalized welcome message.  
If not, print a different personalized message.
