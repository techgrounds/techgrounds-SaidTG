# Advantages of the Cloud

__Optimized costs__

There are significant savings in resource, maintenance, and real estate costs, in addition to the ability to optimize workloads so that they cost less to run.

__Flexibility and scalability__

    Organizations pay only for the cloud resources that they use, meaning that they don't need to pay for and maintain IT assets that they may only use occasionally.

    When demand spikes or the organization needs more powerful compute resources, organizations can alter their resources instantly on demand.

    To keep getting value from their existing IT investments, many organizations adopt a hybrid cloud model, where they migrate some of their workloads to the cloud while keeping others in their existing on-premises environment. (There can be industry compliance benefits to hybrid clouds, too.)

    Most cloud platforms maintain a global presence so that organizations can improve performance by running workloads closer to where their users or customers are.

__Enhanced security__

Many public clouds have built-in security features and specialized cloud security tools to help ensure that an organization's resources are protected. Security patching is done automatically by the cloud provider in many cases.

__Compliance__

Some cloud platforms have specialized offerings to seamlessly meet compliance requirements—this is ideal for highly regulated industries like finance, healthcare, and government.

__Backup, recovery, and failover__

Most cloud providers help to improve business continuity by offering built-in, one-click backup and recovery capabilities. Some providers also offer the ability to store backups in different geographic regions.

__Simplified management and monitoring__

Organizations can manage and monitor their on-premises datacenter and cloud resources from a single screen if the cloud provider offers a central management tool.



## Key-terms

Consumption-based price - You're charged for only what you use. This model is also known as the pay-as-you-go rate.

Cosumption based model means that customers only pay when they use resources, as such they have no upfront cost associated. Because of that you can create resources at any time and delete them at any time, so you don’t waste any resources. Once resources are deleted, customers stop paying.

The consumption-based model is a pricing model used in the cloud so that customers are only charged based on their resource usage.

This model is characterized by

    No associated upfront cost
    No wasted resources as such no charges are incurred for unused resources*. Unused in this case is different per service. For instance, blob storage that stores any data is considered to be used, as it consumes the storage space. Virtual Machines that are running consume CPU, memory and other resources even if there isn’t any traffic. Hence they are considered to be used and will incur charges.
    Pay for what you need
    Stop paying when you don’t

Consumption is the virtual metric used to calculate how much each resource (service) in Azure was used. Each service has many smaller metrics that track its consumption to offer best possible pricing model. Those metrics are tracked on very granular level.

Fixed price - You provision resources and are charged for those instances whether you use them or not.
