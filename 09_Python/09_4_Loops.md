# Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

* while loops
* for loops

---

__Exercise 1:__

* Create a new script.
* Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
* Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop.  
After printing, the value of x should increase by 1.  
The loop
should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

__Exercise 2:__

* Create a new script.
* Copy the code below into your script.

        for i in range(10):
        # do something here

* Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
* Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
* Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

__Exercise 3:__

* Create a new script.
* Copy the array below into your script.

        arr = ["Shikha", "Casper", "Bart", "Ruben", "Ulviye"]

* Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.
