# Lists

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:

---

__Exercise 1:__

__Exercise 2:__

* Create a new script.
* Create a list of five integers.
* Use a for loop to do the following for every item in the list:
    * Print the value of that item added to the value of the next item in the list.
    * If it is the last item, add it to the value of the first item instead (since there is no next item).
