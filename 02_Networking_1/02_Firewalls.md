## Key-terms
1. Hardware Firewalls: These firewalls are implemented as a physical appliance deployed in an organization’s server room or data center. While these firewalls have the advantage of running as “bare metal” and on hardware designed specifically for them, they are also constrained by the limitations of their hardware (number of network interface cards (NICs), bandwidth limitations, etc.).

2. Software Firewalls: Software firewalls are implemented as code on a computer. These firewalls include both the firewalls built into common operating systems and virtual appliances that contain the full functionality of a hardware firewall but are implemented as a virtual machine.

 3. Cloud Firewalls: Organizations are increasingly moving critical data and resources to the cloud, and cloud-native firewalls are designed to follow suit. These virtual appliances are specifically designed to be deployed in the cloud and may be available as either standalone virtual machines or as a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering.
